### A/B test for the second split: mode split
it is the feature of dark mode vs light mode. We want to have different mode for the user preference. Some users might prefer the dark mode and some prefer the light mode. We split the user into half and half. When the feature is on, it would be on the dark mode. When it is off, it would be on the light mode.
